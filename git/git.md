# Git Notes

## Pushed .idea directory into remote respository from pycharm

To remove the .idea directory from the remote repository, you can use the git rm command with the --cached flag to
remove it from the repository but keep it in your local working directory:

```bash
git rm --cached .idea
```

Then, commit the change and push it to the remote repository:

```bash
git commit -m "Removed .idea directory"
git push
```

To prevent the .idea directory from being pushed again in the future, you can add it to your .gitignore file. 

## Understanding conflicts
Initial Branches: You have two branches, "main" and "branch-A."

Committing Changes in Main Branch: Developers have been working on the "main" branch and have made some commits, including a change to a specific piece of code, let's call it "X," which resulted in "X" becoming "Z."

Committing Changes in Branch A: Meanwhile, developers have also been working on "branch-A" and have made some commits, including a change that intended to modify "X" to "Y."

Merge Attempt: When you attempt to merge "branch-A" into "main," Git considers the chronological order of commits. Since the changes in "branch-A" occurred after the latest commit in "main," Git recognizes "branch-A" as having the more recent changes.

Conflict Detection: During the merge process, Git identifies that "branch-A" is trying to change "X" to "Y," but when comparing with the current state of "main," "X" has already been changed to "Z" by some other commit on the "main" branch.

Conflict Resolution: The conflict arises because Git cannot automatically determine which change should take precedence (i.e., "X" to "Y" or "X" to "Z").

Manual Conflict Resolution: As a result, Git halts the merge process and asks you to resolve the conflict manually. You must decide whether to keep "X" as "Z" or accept the change to "Y" from "branch-A," or possibly make a different modification.

Committing Resolved Changes: After manually resolving the conflict by choosing the desired change, you commit the changes to complete the merge.

Merge Completion: The merge is now complete, and the changes from "branch-A" have been successfully integrated into the "main" branch, along with the conflict resolution you performed.

In summary, the conflict occurred because "branch-A" attempted to change "X" to "Y," but "X" had already been changed to "Z" in the "main" branch by another commit. Manual conflict resolution allows you to decide how to handle these conflicting changes and ensure that the final merged state of the code is coherent and reflects the intended modifications from both branches.
